## My process
I started out with building the site by using html, css and vanilla javascript but i was not able to do the the filtering part and also the listing part was very repetitive. To tackle this problem i came to know about react and freshly building up the app.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- React


### What I learned
I learned how to use use react to simplify the repetitive tasks. 

### Continued development
I will exploring more on react and get a good grip on it.

### Useful resources

- [React](https://react.dev/) - This helped me to set up react on my local machine.
